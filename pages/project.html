            <p>Are you tired? Are you too busy to take a 10 minute break to get a coffee? Yet you'd give anything to get one? Don't worry, we know this and that's why we wanted to find a solution to this problem. And it has been done today. We have developed a coffee that is already ready, that can be eaten quickly and all without losing any "energizing" qualit<br><br><br>Discover COBA Coffee Bar, the solution to your coffee needs. It's very simple. We have transformed the classic coffee into a bar. The result is more efficiency and much more practical use.</p>

        <p>We are very attentive to the quality of our products. To do this, we negotiate directly with Peruvian producers. Our coffee beans are therefore from fair trade.<br><br>
            Once the seeds have arrived from Peru, we carry out the transformation in our small workshop. We make our own products.<br><br>We offer 2 types of Coffee bars. One with milk and one "nature". Thus we want to satisfy all types of customers.<br><br>The Kickstarter will allow us to improve our workshop to increase our production and - perhaps - sell one day all over the world.</p>
